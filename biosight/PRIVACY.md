# BioSight AI Privacy & Data Governance

BioSight AI is committed to the "Privacy-by-Design" principle. Our architecture ensures that biomedical research can be conducted without compromising patient anonymity.

## 1. Data Minimization

- **No Accounts**: We do not use usernames, emails, or passwords.
- **Anonymized Sessions**: Your workspace is identified by a transient SHA-256 hash that exists only for the duration of your browser session.
- **Auto-Stripping**: Our "Ingestion Engine" programmatically removes EXIF, GPS, and device-specific metadata from every uploaded specimen.

## 2. The 24-Hour "Transient Storage" Rule

All data uploaded to BioSight AI is subject to an automated **24-hour Time-to-Live (TTL)**.

- **Images**: Deleted from the server filesystem via a CRON task.
- **Interpretations**: Purged from the database by a MySQL event scheduler.
- **Retention**: We do not maintain backups of specimen data once deleted.

## 3. Cryptographic Security

- **Encryption at Rest**: AI interpretations are stored as binary blobs encrypted with **AES-256-CTR**.
- **Secure Transport**: All data transit is protected via TLS 1.3 to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 4. IP & Ownership

- **Codebase**: All application logic and the FastAPI microservice are the intellectual property of the developer.
- **AI Output**: Research findings are generated by the Gemini 1.5 model and are intended for educational reference. They are owned by the active researcher session but are not considered clinical medical records.
