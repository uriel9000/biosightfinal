# 🎙️ BioSight AI: Final Demo Protocol

Follow this structured script to showcase the mission-critical capabilities of BioSight AI to judges.

## 🏗️ Step 1: The "Trust-First" Intake (2 Minutes)

1. **The Land**: Show the dashboard. Point out the premium "Laboratory Instrument" aesthetic.
2. **The Ethics**: Click "Analyze" without accepting terms. Show the system BLOCKING you.
3. **The Consent**: Open the Consent Modal. Briefly explain the **Zero-Diagnosis Protocol** and how we protect local liability. Accept and proceed.

## 🔬 Step 2: Multimodal Magic (3 Minutes)

1. **The Live Analysis**:
   - Click the **"Chest X-Ray"** sample from the Research Bench.
   - Highlight the **Scanner Animation** (Visual feedback).
   - Point out the **Education Hub** (Translating technical findings for students).
2. **The Evidence**: Show the **Confidence Progress Bars**. Explain that Gemini isn't just "guessing"—it's providing a certainty score for every structural feature it sees.

## 📡 Step 3: Resilience & Portability (2 Minutes)

1. **The PWA**: Point to the "Online" badge. Mention that this is fully installable as a native app on Android/iOS.
2. **Offline Logic**: Mention the **IndexedDB Vault**. Explain how a researcher in a remote clinic can capture a specimen, and the app will "wait" until they find signal to sync with Gemini.

## 📄 Step 4: The Professional Artifact (1 Minute)

1. **The Report**: Click **"Download PDF Report"**.
2. **The Print UI**: Show how the dashboard transforms into a clean, academic laboratory document.
3. **The Footer**: Point out the persistent **Non-Diagnostic Disclaimer** at the bottom of the printed page.

## 🏆 Pro-Tips for Victory

- **Mention Gemini 1.5 Flash**: Emphasize how we use it for _Structural Reasoning_, not just object detection.
- **Privacy Hero**: Explicitly mention that all data is purged after 24 hours (TTL).
- **"It's a partner, not a doctor"**: Reiterate that this supports researchers; it doesn't replace clinicians.
